# coconots julia
Implementation of our coconots package in julia using autodiff. Since we are able to use derivatives from autodiff, the optimization is even faster than the RCPP implementation of the original package which can be found [here](https://github.com/manuhuth/coconots).

Currently only the regression function cocoreg (with and without covariates) is implemented.
